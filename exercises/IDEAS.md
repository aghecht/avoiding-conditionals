Ideas for Exercises
===================

Primitive obsession
-------------------

- Phone number. Start as string. Provide list of phone numbers to start with.
  Work towards object. Introduce 'nearby' feature that takes builds on the fact
  that we now have objects (hint: use area code for nearby implementation).

- padded take

Language constructs
-------------------

- `||` instead of nil check

Null object
-----------

- Example with composition, defaulting to some basic version of the object.

- Build on GroceryList example. Print the first items when there is not any
  items. Make Item an object with an attribute that might have a nil
  attribute, like packaging.
